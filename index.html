		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>In my studies, I have learned about various machine learning algorithms, including regression, classification, and clustering. I have also gained experience with programming languages such as Python and R, as well as tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

			One of my favorite parts of studying Machine Learning is the opportunity to apply my knowledge to real-world problems.</p>
